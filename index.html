        <p>Hello! My name is Okechukwu Obi. I am from Nigeria. I enjoy learning web development.
            Its been a wondeful journey through Software development but I thank God that no matter the urge
            to stop along the way, I find strength in God and two wonderful women - my sister and and my wife.

        <p>Nigeria has the largest economy in Africa, driven by oil and gas exports, 
            though it also has a growing tech and entertainment (Nollywood) sector. 
            However, it faces challenges like corruption, poverty, and infrastructure deficits.</p>
